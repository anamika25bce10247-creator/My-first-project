# How it works 
It shifts each letter in the message by fixed numbers.
example:
with the fixed number = 3
"a"→"d"
"x"→"a"
# Features of this project 
1.Encryption of messages. 
2.Decryption of messages.
3.User friendly input system.
4.Handles any shift.
5.No external libraries.
6.Beginner friendly cryptography 
# Requirments 
Python

Only Python's built-in 'string' module is used.
