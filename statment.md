# Problem Statement

The problem is to design a simple Python program that can encrypt and decrypt messages using the classical Caesar Cipher technique. The program should allow users to enter a message, choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt it, and provide a shift key. It must then apply the correct substitution and produce an accurate output while remaining easy for beginners to understand.

# Scope of the Project

1. The program focuses only on implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

2. It handles lowercase alphabet encryption and decryption.

3. It uses Python’s built-in features without external libraries.

4. The scope is educational—helping beginners learn about basic cryptography and string manipulation.

5. It is not designed for real-world secure communication.

# Targeted Users

1. Students learning programming, cryptography, or Python basics.

2. Beginners who want to understand how simple ciphers work.

3. Teachers who need an easy demonstration of encryption concepts.

4. Coding enthusiasts experimenting with classic algorithms.
# HIGH LEVEL FEATURES 

1. User authentication with username and password for access control.
2. Interactive console-based interface for user input.
3. Option to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher method.
4. Customizable shift key to specify the degree of letter shifting.
5. Automatic handling of lowercase alphabets with wrap-around shifting.
6. Continuous operation allowing multiple encrypt/decrypt actions until exit.
7. Clear prompts and feedback for user actions including error handling for invalid choices.
