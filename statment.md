# Problem Statement

The problem is to design a simple Python program that can encrypt and decrypt messages using the classical Caesar Cipher technique. The program should allow users to enter a message, choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt it, and provide a shift key. It must then apply the correct substitution and produce an accurate output while remaining easy for beginners to understand.

# Scope of the Project

The program focuses only on implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

It handles lowercase alphabet encryption and decryption.

It uses Python’s built-in features without external libraries.

The scope is educational—helping beginners learn about basic cryptography and string manipulation.

It is not designed for real-world secure communication.

# Targeted Users

Students learning programming, cryptography, or Python basics.

Beginners who want to understand how simple ciphers work.

Teachers who need an easy demonstration of encryption concepts.

Coding enthusiasts experimenting with classic algorithms.
